1.Use the use case in the class: 


1.1 a. Add more Dense layers to the existing code and check how the accuracy changes.

1.2 Change the data source to Breast Cancer dataset * available in the source code folder and make required changes. Report accuracy of the model. Then we have added the breast cancer dataset then extracting features and labelsthen encoding the label then splitting the data into training and testing dataset and then evaluting the data set.

1.3 Normalize the data before feeding the data to the model and check how the normalization change your
accuracy (code given below).
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
